- How to order rows (`ORDER BY`)
- How to filter aggregated results (`HAVING`)
- How to use some PostgreSQL specific aggregate functions (`ARRAY_AGG`, `STRING_AGG`)

## Tasks

1. Your first task is to create a query to show which product is made by whom. Lists products and their suppliers. Display the `product_name` and the `company_name` of the supplier. Name result columns as `product` and `company` respectively. Order the results alphabetically by `product_name` and by `company_name`. Save your SQL query as `task-1.sql`.
    - The result of your query starts with the following lines:
```
     product      |           company
------------------+-----------------------------
Alice Mutton      | Pavlova, Ltd.
Aniseed Syrup     | Exotic Liquids
Boston Crab Meat  | New England Seafood Cannery
Camembert Pierrot | Gai p√¢turage
Carnarvon Tigers  | Pavlova, Ltd.
```
    - The result of your query contains 77 rows

2. Create a query to reveal how many products are in each category. List categories and number of products. Join tables `products` and `categories`. Name result columns as `category` and `number_of_products`, respectively. Order the results by the number_of_products descending and then by the category name. Save your SQL query as `task-2.sql`.
    - This is the result of your query:
```
    category       | number_of_products
    ---------------+--------------------
    Confections    |                 13
    Beverages      |                 12

```
    - The result of your query contains 8 rows

3. The Head of Sales would like to know which products are the 10 worst performing ones. List product names and the total sum of the order values. Order the results by the `sum` column to start with the worst performing product. Save your SQL query as `task-3.sql`.
    - This is the result of your query:
```
           product_name     | sum

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- You can find the SQL file with the sample data in the data folder.
  To use it, create a new database for this project and use `psql` to
  execute the SQL commands in that file:
    - Start `psql` in a terminal at the `data` folder of the project
    - Connect to your already created new database eg. `\connect northwind`
    - Execute the commands in the sql file `\i northwind_data.sql`
- When you calculate the value of an order make sure you are combining
  `product_price`, `quantity`, and `discount`.
